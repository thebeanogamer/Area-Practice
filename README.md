## Welcome to the website for Area-Practice

Welcome to the website for the Area-Practice program. This is a simple program I created as part of learning Visual Basic. This program allows the user to practice calculating the area of shapes.

### What does it do?

This program allows the user practice calculations for the areas of shapes, although it does not now, in the future I plan for the program to to allow the user to login and for a teacher to view their performance.

This program was created based off a brief which can be found below:

```markdown
The aim of this activity is to produce a computer program which will help students in year 11 practise working out
the area of shapes.
The teacher wants a way of recording when each student has used the program and so students must login to the
program when they run it. The program must work in the following way:
1. A student registers by choosing: a. a username
b. and creating a password, of appropriate strength.
2. Once logged in, a menu of shapes is displayed from which the student can choose the shape they wish to practise.
Shapes could include a triangle, rectangle, or circle.
3. The dimensions of the chosen shape are displayed, along with four possible values for the area. One of the
possible values is the correct answer, and the other three are incorrect.
4. The student must choose one value for the area.
5. The scoring must work as follows: a. If the student chooses the correct answer they score 2 points
b. If they choose one of the incorrect answers, a feedback comment is displayed and they have another chance
c. If the student chooses the correct answer this time, they score 1 point
d. If they choose an incorrect answer again, a feedback comment is displayed together with the correct answer, and
the option of answering another question or quitting the trainer.
6. The student’s total score for the session should be recorded in an external file along with the scores from previous
sessions.
7. When quitting the trainer, the student’s total score for the current session is displayed and they are offered the
following options: a. starting again
b. looking at the record of their scores from their previous sessions
c. closing the program.
